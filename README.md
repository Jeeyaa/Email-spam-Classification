In this GitHub README, you will find a comprehensive project that employs various inbuilt machine learning models for the classification of email spam. The project utilizes the "spam_ham_dataset" obtained from Kaggle, and the models employed include Multinomial Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbors, Extra Tree Classifier, and Random Forest. The accuracy achieved for each model is detailed as follows:
1. Multinomial Naive Bayes: 94.87%.
2. Support Vector Machine: 98.45%.
3. K-Nearest Neighbors: 97.10%.
4. Extra Tree Classifier: 97.97%.
5. Random Forest: 97.97%.
